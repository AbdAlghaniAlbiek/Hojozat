# Hojozat
Booking system for hotels that connect adminstrators, clients, brands (hotels owners) in one place. 

## Overview
This project is the dashboard that shows admins the available hotels on Hojozat db, how booking process is running in whole system, give a quick look about clients feedback (their rating and comments) on brand's hotels and finally show charts about increasing payments in Hojozat system. We used to complete this mission a dashboard using awesome UWP application and  
2 android applications for brands and clients.

Its built using UWP (Universal windows platform) technology, that unlock all features of Windows 10 from security, light/dark theming, gorgeous design and built-in OS apis, so its considered the most futurestic technology to build desktop/hololens applications.

I used many usefull libraries that helped me complete this project in best way like: Refit, CommunityToolkit and Telerik for charts

Ofcourse the security is a major part on the Hojozat system so the security integration between frontend (UWP dashboard, 2 android apps)
